<p>So you've drafted a team. Now what?</p>

<p>Maybe one of your players gets injured, or you just decide you don't like his face. Maybe too many of your players have the same bye week and you need to find a replacement to fill your lineup. Whatever the case, at some point you're going to want to learn to add, drop and trade players.</p>

<h5>Adding a player</h5>

<p>You can add any player that isn't already on someone else's roster. In the players list on the league site you'll see that the "owner" column will sometimes say "FA", and sometimes say "W (Aug 25)" where Aug 25 is an example clearing date. Both of these mean the player can be added to your team.</p>

<p><strong>FA = Free Agent.</strong> This is easy. Click the plus sign next to the player to add them, and if your roster is already full you'll be asked to select one of your existing guys to drop and make room. Once you've done so and confirmed, the transaction will go through immediately and you will have your new player.</p>

<p><strong>W(DATE) = Waivers.</strong> This is a bit more complicated. Any player dropped from another roster, or whose team has played this week, will be on waivers which means you can't pick them up immediately. Follow the process for adding a FA player, but you'll also be asked to bid something from your 200 waiver acquisition budget (WAB). On the waiver clear date, whoever has the highest bid will get that player. In the event of a tie, whoever has highest waiver priority will get them. If you don't win a player, you won't pay your bid amount.</p>

<p>Players that clear waivers without being bid on will become free agents.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> WAB bids of 0 will be accepted.</p>

<h5>Dropping a player</h5>

<p>You can do this at any time, basically, but it's most common as part of adding another player as above.</p>

<h5>Trades</h5>

<p>Trading is more common in bigger leagues where there aren't as many good players available to pick up, but it's still good to know how to do them. Click on a team name from the main league homepage and you'll see a list of their players with a black bar at the top including the link to "propose trade". From there, basically follow the instructions! Trades can be accepted by the other player, declined, or they might send you a counter-offer.</p>

<p>Beware of accepting scam trades from less scrupulous opponents, it's up to you to know whether what you're accepting is good value or not. If in doubt you can always get advice on <a href="#" target="_blank">/r/fantasyfootball</a> or similar.</p>

    <p>Step 1) Cease thy panic.</p>
    <p>Step 2) You should have the NFL Fantasy app installed on your phone for occasions such as this. It'll let you set your lineup by dragging benched players into active spots, but it'll also give you a big blue "Optimize Lineup" button so that even if you're totally snowed under and can't spare a thought for fantasy, you can hit that button and get some semblance of a valid lineup set.</p>

    <div class="card-body">
    <p>Well first off, you might not be doing anything wrong. If you're getting consistently high scores but still losing, you're just getting unlucky with your opponents. It happens. (Example: In my keeper league in 2017 I was the highest scoring team in the whole league. Didn't even make the playoffs.)</p>
    <p>If you're not scoring highly, you need to look at which players are consistently letting you down and consider whether you need to replace them (see above for "How can I improve my team?".</p>
    <p>Watch out for injuries too, the last thing you want is to start an injured player and have him earn you zero points. You can set the NFL Fantasy app to alert you to injuries on your roster, and the league site will also show player news in the sidebar.</p>
