    <ol>
        <li id="const-owners">
            Owners:
            <ol>
                <li>As of the 2018 season the SJML will consist of 8 owners. This number may increase in future years.</li>
                <li>If for any reason an owner leaves the SJML between seasons, the other owners may nominate someone to take their place. Final approval of new owners rests with the commissioner.</li>
                <li>If for any reason an owner leaves the SJML during the season, the commissioner may temporarily appoint a new owner to finish the season. Once the season has ended, if the temporary owner wishes to stay permanently, final approval rests with the commissioner.</li>
                <li>If an owner leaves the SJML during the season and a replacement cannot be found, the commissioner will set lineups for that team based on NFL.com predicted points. If no players are available on the absent owner's roster to fill a position (due to injury or bye weeks), a waiver bid will be entered for the top predicted player(s) for a maximum of 10% of the starting WAB, and the player with the lowest prediction (or the injured player) will be dropped.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="const-rosters">Rosters:
            <ol>
                <li>Each team of the SJML will have a maximum of 15 players on its roster, coming from any team in the NFL.</li>
                <li>The roster will consist of 9 starting positions. All players not in the starting lineup will be placed on the bench.</li>
                <li>Rosters do not necessarily need to be full at all times.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="const-draft">Draft:
            <ol>
                <li>Every year, before the season starts, the SJML will hold an online draft at the most convenient date and time possible for everyone involved.</li>
                <li>The draft must be held and completed before the opening kick-off of the first game of the NFL season.</li>
                <li>The draft order will be determined randomly in the first year (2018), and will snake until all teams have a full 15 player roster. At the start of the next season, all teams will draft again from scratch.</li>
                <li>In the event that an owner cannot attend the draft, their team will be automatically drafted based on their pre-set player rankings.</li>
                <li>Owners are not allowed to trade draft picks.</li>
                <li>An owner can draft any number of players from any number of positions until they have filled all 15 slots in their roster.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="const-lineups">Starting Lineups:
            <ol>
                <li>Each team in the SJML can change its lineup anytime throughout the week, but once a player's game kicks off, that player is locked into his position until the end of the week.</li>
                <li>A valid starting lineup consists of the following: 1 QB, 2 RB's, 2 WR's, 1 TE, 1 K, 1 DEF, 1 Flex.</li>
                <li>The Flex position may consist of either 1 RB or 1 WR.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="const-changes">Roster Changes:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Adds</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>All NFL players are available to add (either through free agents or waivers) as long as they are not already owned by another team.</li>
                        <li>Owners can only add players if there is room on their roster to do so.</li>
                        <li>If a player does not have room on their roster to add a new player, they must drop a player from their roster in order to make room.</li>
                        <li>There is no limit to how many players an owner adds throughout the season.</li>
                        <li>There is no limit to how many players an owner adds in any given week.</li>
                        <li>There is no limit to how many players an owner adds on any given day.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Drops</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>With the exception of the NFL.com undroppable players list, any player may be dropped from an owner's roster at any time. However, if the dropped player has already played that week, the drop will not process until the week is over.</li>
                        <li>An owner may drop a player even without adding a replacement.</li>
                        <li>Any player dropped is placed on the waiver wire.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Waivers</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Free agents will switch to waivers at the start of their team's weekly game.</li>
                        <li>Each owner will receive a waiver acquisition budget (WAB) of 200 to last the entire season.</li>
                        <li>Waiver bids of 0 will be accepted.</li>
                        <li>In the event of a tied bid between two or more owners, waiver priority will be used as the tie-breaker.</li>
                        <li>If a player clears waivers with no bids, they will become a free agent and can be picked up by any owner for free.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Trades</strong>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Trades can be made at any time through Week 11 between any two teams.</li>
                        <li>No trades may be made after Week 11 (see league site for exact date).</li>
                        <li>There will be a 1-day trade review period, during which trades may be vetoed by the league commissioner. This will only take place in the event of collusion, to be determined by the league commissioner.</li>
                        <li>Suspicions of collusion should be reported to the commissioner as soon as possible after a potential trade is made public.</li>
                        <li>All trades will be processed once both teams agree to it and the 1-day review period has passed. However, if one or more players involved in the trade have already played in a game, the trade will not process until the week is over.</li>
                        <li>Under no circumstances will the 1-day trade review period be waived.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="const-scoring">Scoring:
        <ol>
            <li>Scores will be calculated as per the settings on the league website. It is each owner's responsibility to research the league's scoring settings.</li>
            <li>The commissioner must finalise scoring settings at least a week before the draft.</li>
            <li>Please note both fractional and negative point scorings are in use.</li>

                <li>The schedule is determined by the commissioner and must be finalized prior to the draft.</li>
                <li>Each team will play every other team in the league at least 2 times.</li>
                <li>Each week, the team that gets more points than their opponent gets the win.</li>
                <li>In the event that both teams score the same amount of points a tie is declared and is so reflected in the standings.</li>
                <li>The "Regular Season" takes place between weeks 1-14.</li>
                <li>The "Playoffs" take place between weeks 15-16.</li>
                <li>The league rankings are determined by the standings.</li>

        <li id="const-commissioner">Commissioner:
            <ol>
                <li><strong>The commissioner sets the schedule</strong> for each season, with the following conditions:
                    <ol>
                        <li>The schedule must be finalized before the day of the draft.</li>
                        <li>Each team must play every other team twice.</li>
                        <li>Where possible, each season must begin with the same matchups from the previous year's week 16 games.</li>
                        <li>Weeks 3 & 13 are "Rivalry Weeks"</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li><strong>The commissioner has the power to correct mistakes</strong> made by an owner provided that the owner immediately informs the commissioner of the mistake as soon as he or she realizes their error. (Example: Owner X wants to drop New England's Defense, but accidently clicks on Houston's Defense and drops them instead. Since Houston's Defense is now technically on waivers and Owner X can't immediately correct their own mistake, Owner X can inform the commissioner of their mistake and the commissioner can correct it.)
                    <ol>
                        <li>The commissioner must be informed of a mistake within 24 hours of when the mistake occurred.</li>
                        <li>All corrections are at the sole digression of the commissioner.</li>
                        <li>Corrections must be explained clearly by the Commissioner on the league message board.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>If the commissioner cannot perform his or her duties during the season, he or she may appoint another owner as acting commissioner until he or she is able to continue with his or her duties.</li>
                <li>Between seasons, a vote may be called in order to select a new commissioner. For this to happen, a new commissioner must be nominated to take over the duties. Each owner will cast a vote on who they want the commissioner to be. In order for a new commissioner to be elected, they must receive at least 50% of the votes. In the event of a tie, the current commissioner casts a second vote.</li>
                <li>In the event of a tie in any vote, the Commissioner always gets an extra vote.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="const-conditions">Conditions:
            <ol>
                <li>Any rule not specifically covered within this constitution shall revert to the NFL.com Fantasy Football website's rules.</li>
                <li>Any rule not specifically covered within this constitution or on the NFL.com Fantasy Football website are to be ruled on by the commissioner.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li id="const-amendments">Amendments:
            <ol>
                <li>Amendments to this constitution can only be made with the approval of 3/4 of the owners (6 votes.)</li>
                <li>Any amendment may be brought to the commissioner at any time.</li>
                <li>Any owner proposing an amendment must provide sound reasoning for the change and how it will benefit the league.</li>
                <li>Any other owner(s) may dispute the change before a vote is held.</li>
                <li>The commissioner has sole digression on if/when a vote will be held during the season.</li>
                <li>If an amendment is proposed during the offseason, the commissioner must hold a vote and has until one week prior to the draft of the coming season to do so.</li>
